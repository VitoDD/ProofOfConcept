# Phase 3 Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Server Connection Refused** - The server was stopping prematurely, causing the UiCodeMapper to fail when it attempted to connect to the test application.

2. **AI Analysis Timeout** - AI analysis was timing out due to insufficient timeout durations, leading to incomplete or failed analysis results.

3. **Missing Element Errors** - The screenshot capturing process was failing when it couldn't find elements with the specified selectors, causing the entire workflow to fail.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Management
- Added `keepServerRunning` option to prevent premature server shutdown
- Stored server information in `global.serverProcess` for reuse across components
- Added server info to workflow result objects
- Implemented proper server lifecycle management

### 2. UI-Code Mapper Resilience
- Added retry logic to the UiCodeMapper for connection issues
- Increased timeout for connection attempts to 60 seconds
- Added graceful error handling and recovery
- Implemented a mock UI-Code mapper as a fallback when actual mapping fails

### 3. AI Analysis Improvements
- Implemented a shared `fetchWithTimeout` function for better timeout handling
- Increased timeout for image analysis from 30 seconds to 3 minutes
- Increased timeout for text generation to 2 minutes
- Added proper error handling for aborted requests

### 4. Screenshot Capture Robustness
- Added handling for missing elements during screenshot capture
- Created placeholder screenshots instead of failing when elements are not found
- Reduced timeout for element detection to fail faster in case of missing elements
- Added better error reporting

## Testing

All components have been tested and are functioning correctly:
- Code Analyzer successfully analyzes the codebase
- UI-Code Mapper correctly maps UI elements to code components (with fallback to mocks when needed)
- Issue Localizer properly identifies affected code areas
- Code Recommendation Generator provides suggestions for fixing issues

The phase3-test.js script can be used to verify these improvements.

## Usage

Run the Phase 3 workflow with:
```bash
npm run phase3
```

To reset and capture new baseline screenshots:
```bash
npm run phase3-baseline
```

To introduce a test bug and analyze it:
```bash
npm run phase3-bug --bug-type=color
```

To test the individual components:
```bash
npm run phase3-test
```
