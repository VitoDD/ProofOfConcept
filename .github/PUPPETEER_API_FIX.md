# Puppeteer API Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The visual testing workflow was failing with:
```
Error capturing current screenshots: TypeError: page.waitForTimeout is not a function
```

## Root Cause
**Puppeteer API Change**: In Puppeteer v21+, the `page.waitForTimeout()` method was deprecated and replaced with `page.waitForDelay()`.

Your project was using the old API:
```javascript
await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // ❌ Removed in v21+
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Compatibility Helper Function
Added a universal wait function that works across Puppeteer versions:

```javascript
async function waitFor(page, milliseconds) {
  try {
    // Try new API first (Puppeteer v21+)
    if (typeof page.waitForDelay === 'function') {
      await page.waitForDelay(milliseconds);
    } else if (typeof page.waitForTimeout === 'function') {
      // Fallback to old API (Puppeteer v20 and below)
      await page.waitForTimeout(milliseconds);
    } else {
      // Fallback to basic timeout
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`Wait function failed, using basic timeout: ${error.message}`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated All Wait Calls
Replaced all instances of:
```javascript
await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // ❌ Old API
```

With:
```javascript
await waitFor(page, 1000); // ✅ Compatible API
```

### 3. Added API Testing
Enhanced the Puppeteer test to verify wait function compatibility before running actual tests.

## Files Modified
- `src/phase1/screenshot.js` - Main screenshot capture logic
- `test-puppeteer.js` - Puppeteer installation test

## Benefits
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Works with older Puppeteer versions
- ✅ **Forward Compatible** - Works with newer Puppeteer versions  
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback** - Uses basic timeout if both APIs fail
- ✅ **Better Error Handling** - Continues execution even if wait fails

## Expected Results
After this fix:
1. ✅ Screenshot capture completes successfully
2. ✅ No more "waitForTimeout is not a function" errors
3. ✅ Current screenshots are generated properly
4. ✅ Visual comparison proceeds normally
5. ✅ Full Phase 1 workflow completion

## Testing
The compatibility helper is tested in `test-puppeteer.js` and will verify that wait functions work correctly before proceeding with the main workflow.

## Other Puppeteer API Changes to Watch For
If you encounter other Puppeteer compatibility issues in the future, common changes include:
- `page.waitForTimeout()` → `page.waitForDelay()`
- `page.waitFor()` → `page.waitForSelector()` or `page.waitForFunction()`
- Some launch options may have changed names

The compatibility helper pattern can be extended for other API changes as needed.
